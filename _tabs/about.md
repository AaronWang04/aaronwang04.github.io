Hello! I'm Aaron Wang, a third-year student at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Engineering. Currently, I am interning at [CentML](https://centml.ai/){:target="_blank"} as a ML Systems Engineer and I help with optimizing LLM inferencing.

I have previously interned at [Huawei](https://www.huawei.com/ca/){:target="_blank"} as a research engineer on the AI infrastructure team. I helped research optimization within AI systems, especially on the distributed training side. I have co-authored a paper (currently under review!) on collective communication scheduling methods in GPU clusters. I assisted with implememnting a simulator, running experiments, and analyzing data! 

On the side, I also help lead & write drone software at the [University of Waterloo Aerial Robotics Group](https://www.uwarg.com/){:target="_blank"}. We build anything software related to help drones fly, from computer vision models to fullstack ground station software.

In the future I plan to do a blog about each of my projects on this website!
